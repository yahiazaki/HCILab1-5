# Housing Application System

## Problem Definition

The project requires the development of a housing application system that allows users to browse available housing locations and submit applications. The system needs to:

- Display a list of available housing locations with their details
- Show detailed information for each housing location including amenities and availability
- Allow users to submit applications for housing
- Maintain and serve housing data through a RESTful API
- Provide real-time updates of housing availability and information

## Solution Approach

- **Frontend Development with Angular**

  - Implement component-based architecture for modular development
  - Create separate components for home listing, details view, and housing location display
  - Use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience

- **Data Management**

  - Implement HousingLocation interface with required properties:
    - Basic details (id, name, city, state)
    - Visual content (photo)
    - Availability information (availableUnits)
    - Amenity flags (wifi, laundry)
  - Use JSON Server for RESTful API implementation
  - Implement async data fetching with error handling

- **Service Implementation**

  - Create HousingService for centralized data access
  - Implement methods for:
    - Fetching all housing locations
    - Getting specific housing details by ID
    - Processing housing applications
  - Use dependency injection for service management

- **User Interface Features**

  - Design responsive layout for cross-device compatibility
  - Implement interactive housing listing with filtering
  - Create detailed view for individual housing information
  - Build application submission form with validation
  - Add visual indicators for housing amenities

- **Technical Features**
  - Implement RESTful API integration
  - Use Angular's built-in routing for navigation
  - Apply reactive programming patterns
  - Implement error handling and loading states

This solution provides a scalable and maintainable approach to managing housing applications while ensuring a good user experience and efficient data management.
